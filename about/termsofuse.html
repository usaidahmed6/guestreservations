            <h3>Legal Contract</h3>


            <p>These Terms of Use (“Contract”) constitute a legal contract between you and Guest Reservations (“Travel
                Agent,” “Guest Reservations,” “we,” or “us”). By using Travel Agent’s website at guestreservations.com
                (“Site”), you agree to these terms and the separate <a href="privacy.html"
                                                                       title="the Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
                <strong>You understand and agree that Travel Agent is a third-party independent travel network that only
                    provides travel booking services. Travel Agent is not a hotel, and you understand that by using the
                    Site, you are not booking directly with a hotel</strong>. As adequate consideration for
                your assent to this Contract, you are provided access to the Site, Travel Agent’s hotel-booking
                services, and Travel Agent’s 24/7 Customer Call Center (collectively, the “Services”). You must be 18 to
                use the Site and Services and legally authorized to enter into this Contract. The reference to “you” or
                “your” means the user using the Site or Services. The Site may contain hyperlinks to websites operated
                by third parties other than Travel Agent; Travel Agent does not control such third-party websites or
                links and is not responsible for their contents or the privacy or other practices of such third parties.
            </p>

            <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>

            <p>This section explains how you and Travel Agent will handle disputes that arise. It is an important
                section of this Contract, and you should read it carefully.
            </p>

            <p><u>Claims and Law.</u> A “Claim” means and includes any claim or dispute between you and Travel Agent or
                you and any third-party beneficiary (collectively “Travel Agent” for this arbitration agreement) arising
                out of or related to this Contract, the Privacy Policy, the Services, any dealings with Travel Agent,
                any representations or omissions by Travel Agent, or the Site. This Contract, including the enforcement
                and interpretation of this dispute resolution provision, and any Claims that might arise between you and
                Travel Agent, whether based on contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall be exclusively governed by
                and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and, if not
                inconsistent, the state laws of Delaware in the United States, exclusive of choice of law rules.</p>

            <p><u>Informal Dispute Resolution.</u> Our goal is customer satisfaction and working with you to try to
                resolve any Claims. Before seeking relief through arbitration, you agree that you will first notify our
                Customer Service Department to try to resolve any Claim(s) against Travel Agent. You can reach our
                Customer Service Department by phone and/or email, at (866) 238-4218 or
                <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#3b575e5c5a577b5c4e5e484f495e485e494d5a4f5254554815585456"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9bf7fefcfaf7dbfceefee8efe9fee8fee9edfaeff2f4f5e8b5f8f4f6">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. You understand and
                acknowledge that participating in this informal process is a prerequisite to initiating any arbitration
                or proceeding in small claims court to the fullest extent permissible under applicable laws.</p>

            <p><u>Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice Procedure.</u> If the Claim is not resolved through Informal Dispute
                Resolution, before either party commences an arbitration for any Claim, the aggrieved party (“Claimant”)
                must follow this Pre-Arbitration Notice Procedure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Claimant must first send the other party a formal written notice of the Claim (hereinafter, the “Notice”). The Claimant’s Notice must:</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>be sent by certified mail, with a copy also sent by email to <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b6dad3d1d7daf6d1c3d3c5c2c4d3c5d3c4c0d7c2dfd9d8c598d5d9db">[email&#160;protected]</a>;</li>
                    <li>be addressed to 4023 Kennett Pike # 53238, Wilmington, DE 19807-2018 if against Travel Agent or
                        any of its third-party beneficiaries, or to your address on file with Travel Agent;</li>
                    <li>contain the Claimant’s full name, postal address, and email address;</li>
                    <li>describe all the relevant facts and the basis of the Claim including whether there is a
                        registered account or transaction with Travel Agent;</li>
                    <li>describe all damages and requests for recovery that the Claimant is seeking and how the damages
                        or requests are calculated;</li>
                    <li>provide a statement signed by the Claimant personally if an individual or an executive if a
                        company (and not the Claimant’s attorney), verifying the accuracy of all the information in the
                        Notice, and containing only information about the Claimant and not any dispute that others may
                        have.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>After receipt of the Notice, as evidenced by certified mail receipts, the parties will negotiate in
                    good faith to resolve the dispute for a period of 45 days. Both you and Travel Agent agree that
                    after a Notice is received, either party may request an individualized internet video conference or
                    telephone call, attended by both parties and optionally attended by legal counsel; the parties agree
                    to cooperate to schedule this personal, individualized video session or phone call as soon as
                    reasonably possible to resolve the matter, although it may be held after the 45-day period as long
                    as it was requested within the 45-day period.</li>
                <li>If the parties do not reach an agreement on the issues contained in the Notice within 45 days of
                    receipt of the Notice and after good faith negotiations, the Claimant may commence an arbitration
                    proceeding.</li>
                <li>Compliance with the Informal Dispute Resolution process and the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice
                    Procedure (collectively, the “Notice Procedure”), as described above, is a condition precedent to
                    initiating arbitration. Any statutes of limitations periods are tolled while the parties are
                    engaging in the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice Procedure.</li>
                <li>All aspects of the Notice Procedure are required in order to provide a full opportunity for the
                    parties to resolve their Claim(s).</li>
                <li>If the Claimant does not comply with any of the requirements of the Notice Procedure, a court must
                    enjoin an arbitration filing or continued prosecution of an arbitration. Furthermore, unless
                    prohibited by law, an administrator of any arbitration may not initiate, access, or assess or demand
                    fees related to an arbitration that has been commenced without the parties completing the Notice
                    Procedure. If an arbitration is filed or otherwise pending prior to the parties completing the
                    Notice Procedure, the arbitration shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this arbitration
                    agreement shall limit a party from seeking damages for noncompliance with the Notice Procedure.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u>Arbitration Agreement.</u> You and Travel Agent agree that any and all Claims, if they cannot be
                resolved through the Notice Procedure, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding
                arbitration, except as otherwise expressly provided below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This means that you and Travel Agent agree that all Claims will only be resolved through arbitration
                    and not in a court of law. Arbitration offers a less formal and more confidential method for
                    resolving disputes. Rather than appearing in court, the involved parties present their arguments and
                    evidence to an arbitrator. The arbitrator then renders a decision, determining the "winning" party
                    by applying the law, much like a judge would in a courtroom setting.</li>
                <li>You and Travel Agent agree that any arbitration shall be governed by applicable rules of National
                    Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”) (including the
                    <a href="https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Comprehensive-Rules-as-of-4.18.2022.pdf">

                    Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings</a>, as applicable) (“NAM Rules”), as modified by the
                    arbitration agreement contained in these terms, and will be administered by NAM. If NAM is
                    unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties
                    that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the
                    court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §5. The NAM Rules are available online at www.NAMADR.com, by calling NAM,
                    or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to commence an
                    arbitration

                    or by contacting NAM.</li>
                <li>Arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who will resolve any Claims between you and
                    Travel Agent (including any disagreements regarding the scope, enforceability, formation,
                    interpretation, applicability, enforceability, voidness, or voidability of this Contract or dispute
                    resolution provision). All remedies shall be available; the arbitrator's award on the Claim(s) shall
                    be final and binding. However, a court of competent jurisdiction may enter judgment on the
                    arbitrator’s award (see further details below). </li>
                <li>The arbitration will be conducted in person in the county where you live or at another mutually
                    agreed location and, at the request of either party, may be conducted by telephone, videoconference,
                    or written submissions.</li>
                <li>Payment of fees, including filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the NAM
                    Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. Each party shall pay its own
                    attorneys’ fees, unless otherwise authorized by statute.</li>
                <li>Upon request by one or more affected parties, the arbitrator may, at their discretion, consolidate
                    multiple arbitrations involving related claims. This consolidation aims to streamline the
                    arbitration process, ensuring efficiency, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness. While all parties
                    retain the right to request individualized hearings, it is important to note that the arbitrator
                    cannot preside over any form of representative or class proceeding unless all individuals have
                    initiated and are currently pursuing arbitration under this Agreement.</li>
                <li>As in court, you and Travel Agent agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration
                    certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the
                    requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or
                    relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized
                    to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable
                    federal or state law, against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u>Limitation to Arbitration.</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Notwithstanding the above, in lieu of arbitration, you or Travel Agent may bring any individual
                    Claim in small claims court, but only if the Claim(s) are brought on an individual basis and are
                    below the statutory maximum amount permitted in small claims court. If you choose to pursue the
                    Claim(s) in a small claims action, the small claims action may only be filed in the country of your
                    residence or in Sussex County Superior Court in Delaware.</li>
                <li>Nothing in this section will limit either party’s ability, if and as allowed by applicable law, to
                    seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration or a “public injunction” in a court of competent
                    jurisdiction or to seek to compel arbitration, to stay a case during arbitration, or to enter
                    judgment on, confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award.</li>
                <li>Arbitration is required if you reside, or if you bring a Claim, in the United States or any country
                    that enforces arbitration agreements. If you are not bringing a Claim in, and are not a resident of,
                    the United States, you may be allowed to file a Claim in a court of competent jurisdiction on an
                    individual, and not class-wide, basis in the city in which you reside under the laws of the city in
                    which you reside, after completing the Notice Procedure.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u>Class Action Waiver.</u> YOU AND TRAVEL AGENT MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL
                BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR PARTY IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE
                ARBITRATOR MAY NOT JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY CLASS,
                REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION, EXCEPT AS PERMITTED HEREIN. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ONLY AWARD
                RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE
                RELIEF REQUIRED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS. THE PARTIES ARE WAIVING RIGHTS TO BRING CLAIMS IN
                COURT ON A CLASS BASIS AND BEFORE A JURY. THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL PROVISION OF THIS CONTRACT; IF THIS
                WAIVER IS LIMITED OR VOIDED, THE CONTRACT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID, SUBJECT TO THE RIGHT TO
                APPEAL THE LIMITATION OF THE WAIVER. YOU AGREE THAT WITHOUT THESE TERMS, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE
                IN COURT WITH A JURY.</p>

            <p><u>Reciprocal.</u> This dispute resolution section is reciprocal and shall not be construed against the
                drafting party. If any provision is not enforceable, that provision shall be severed from the agreement,
                and the agreement will be otherwise enforced.</p>


            <h3>Third-Party Beneficiaries</h3>

            <p>To provide you with the Services, including to assist in fulfilling reservations, Travel Agent uses the
                services and licenses the platform of a third-party vendor as a hotel booking engine (“Vendor”). The
                provisions of this Contract relating to dispute resolution, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and
                indemnification shall also apply to Vendor, as well as to Travel Agent’s representatives, agents,
                suppliers, employees, owners, directors, and officers, who shall be express third-party beneficiaries of
                such provisions.  You and Travel Agent intend to benefit the Vendor with this provision, including
                allowing Vendor to enforce the terms of the Contract against You. The intention of You and Travel Agent
                to benefit Vendor by this Contract is a material part of the purpose of You and Travel Agent entering
                the Contract.</p>

            <h3>Disclaimers of Warranties</h3>

            <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TRAVEL AGENT DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED,
                INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND
                NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TRAVEL
                AGENT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE
                CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SITE OR SERVERS WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. TRAVEL AGENT
                DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SUITABILITY, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY,
                COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS OF ANY MATERIAL ON THE SITE OR SERVICES. TRAVEL AGENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
                ANY FAILURES CAUSED BY SERVER ERRORS, FAILED INTERNET CONNECTIONS, OR ANY COMPUTER VIRUS OR OTHER
                TECHNICAL DEFECT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE THAT A USER WILL RECEIVE THE LOWEST AVAILABLE PRICE FOR A BOOKING,
                REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR REGARDING THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM
                THE SERVICES. BY OFFERING TRAVEL IN PARTICULAR DESTINATIONS, WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH AREAS
                IS ADVISABLE; TRAVEL AGENT IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH
                DESTINATIONS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT
                APPLY TO YOU.
            </p>

            <h3>Limitations of Liability</h3>

            <p>Travel Agent does not guarantee the accuracy of, and disclaims all liability for, any errors or other
                inaccuracies on the Site, including for pricing and other descriptions. The third-party hotels with
                offers available through the Site are independent contractors and not agents, employees, or
                representatives of Travel Agent; and Travel Agent is not liable for the acts, errors, omissions,
                representations, warranties, breaches, or violations of such third parties. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
                PERMITTED BY LAW, TRAVEL AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR
                CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, THE SITE OR SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF
                LEGAL THEORY OR PRIOR NOTICE.
                SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND WAIVERS MAY
                NOT APPLY TO YOU.
            </p>

            <h3>Authorization of Charges; Fees and Taxes</h3>

            <p>You authorize Travel Agent to book reservations for the price charged by the respective hotel(s), plus amounts related to
                any applicable fees and taxes (including but not limited to Service Fees charged by Travel Agent,
                outlined below, and tax recovery charges, which are the estimated taxes to be paid to the hotel). Upon submitting your reservation request, you authorize Travel Agent to process any and
                all reservations on your behalf (and for any guests), including making any necessary payment arrangements. There are some
                rates and fees that are specifically identified as nonrefundable that cannot be refunded; and there may
                be other fees imposed by hotels (including resort fees and room charges), and if the reservation is not cancelled by the indicated time required,
                the entire amount, including the hotel fees, the hotel taxes, and Travel Agent’s Service Fees may be
                forfeited and nonrefundable.</p>

            <p><strong>Travel Agent charges fees for using the Travel Agent Site and Services, including for website, processing, delivery,
                    fulfillment, and customer service fees (collectively “Service Fees”)</strong>. Service Fees may vary
                depending on the type of booking made. Travel Agent has sole discretion to determine the amount of
                Service Fees, and any applicable Service Fees, including any tax recovery charges, will be disclosed to you prior to
                making a purchase on the Travel Agent Site. <strong>Service Fees may be nonrefundable,</strong>e.g.,
                Travel Agent may charge a nonrefundable $14.99 Booking Fee related to processing your transaction, and
                Travel Agent may retain any nonrefundable Service Fees even if you change or cancel a booking or do not
                fulfill your obligations under this Contract, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Further,
                Travel Agent may retain a $10.00 processing fee if you change or cancel reservations booked from Travel
                Agent’s unpublished rates (e.g., call center only specials or pre-negotiated promotions for any Travel
                Agent Services).
            </p>

            <p>You acknowledge that you have requested that Travel Agent provide you booking services and to act as your
                agent in booking reservations at your hotel(s). You acknowledge that the rates displayed on the Site are
                a combination of the hotel charges/fees, our Service Fees, and government imposed taxes or fees, as
                outlined to you, and subject to additional amounts.</p>

            <h3>Accounts</h3>

            <p>To use parts of the Services, such as special promotional offers, you may be required to create an account 
                with your email address. You warrant that you will only provide accurate and non-misleading information 
                for your account and that you will not create more than one account or impersonate anyone. You understand 
                you are responsible for activity under your account and for securing account credentials. You should 
                immediately notify us if you suspect any suspicious activity with your account. We may suspend or terminate 
                your account if we suspect fraud or violation of the Contract or any laws in connection with your account 
                or use of the Services.</p>

            <h3>Quoted Pricing and Rates; Provider Terms</h3>

            <p>Prices quoted on the Site are subject to change and correction at any time, but changes will not affect
                bookings already accepted. TRAVEL AGENT EXPRESSLY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CORRECT ANY PRICING ERRORS. IN
                SUCH EVENT, IF AVAILABLE, WE WILL OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP YOUR PENDING RESERVATION AT THE
                CORRECT PRICE OR WE WILL CANCEL YOUR RESERVATION WITHOUT PENALTY. Special offers and discount pricing of
                Services are only available at participating providers of those services pursuant to their terms. Prices
                shown on the Site include applicable discounts and are based upon rates set by each hotel providing
                those services. Minimum stays may be required. Sale offers are subject to availability and may be
                discontinued without notice. Additional restrictions and blackout dates may apply. Fees and taxes for
                the room rate(s) will be listed, such as on the final pricing and on the confirmation email.
                However, the final rate quoted in the confirmation email does not include specific charges assessed by
                the hotel for miscellaneous expenses that you may incur, such as parking, room service, resort fees,
                city taxes, other taxes, internet use, or other miscellaneous charges. Posted rates are intended merely
                as guidelines and not as any form of guarantee of the final charges after your hotel stay. Because
                Travel Agent only assists you in making reservations, it has no control or authority over the hotel
                providers’ rates, charges, or services, or over hotel providers’ maintenance, updates, renovations,
                quality, or deterioration of hotel rooms.</p>

            <p>Your applicable hotel provider may have additional terms and conditions, including regarding payments,
                availability, health and safety (including regarding COVID testing or vaccine requirements, or pool,
                travel, or stay restrictions), cancellations, and liability waivers, which you must agree to abide by
                and should review carefully; failure to comply with or violation of any such terms and conditions may
                result in cancellation of your reservation or purchase and/or denial of access to any hotel(s). You may
                forfeit any monies paid for such reservation(s) or purchase(s), including all fees; and you authorize
                Travel Agent to debit your account for any costs Travel Agent incurs as a result of any such violation.
                You may be required to provide official state or authorized government issued ID upon check-in for any
                Travel Agent reservation. In addition, you may be required to provide a credit or debit card upon
                request from the hotel for incidentals (such as room service, valet, additional hotel taxes, fees,
                internet, beverages, spa services, and other fees and incidentals). Your failure to produce such ID may
                result in forfeiture of the booking through Travel Agent’s Services without any right to refund.</p>

            <h3>Cancellations and Changes</h3>

            <p>You understand that when you book through the Site, any cancellation or change policy outlined to you,
                including in the confirmation email to you, is enforceable and binding. Travel Agent does not change or
                modify existing nights to reservations. You can cancel your reservation either online at our Site or by
                calling our customer service number. You may add additional services to an existing reservation provided
                the services desired are still available, and under the terms that are available at the time of the
                modification. You may be charged change and/or cancellation fees, or may not be refunded, depending on
                the nature of the request.</p>

            <p>Each reservation is subject to the hotel providers’ change and cancellation policy, which varies by
                provider. In the case of hotels and room reservations, the typical provider usually requires notice of
                cancellation at least 24 to 72 hours prior to your arrival date. You may cancel your prepaid hotel
                reservation(s), but you will be charged the change or cancellation fee(s) as stated on your confirmation
                email or as indicated in the policy for the hotel. If you do not change or cancel your reservation
                before the period applicable to the hotel you reserved, you will be subject to a charge as outlined in
                the hotel’s policy, which may be equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges, and service
                fees. <strong>NOTE: Some hotels charge for the entire stay</strong>. There are no refunds for no-shows
                or early check-outs. If you intend to arrive at your hotel after the first night of your reservation,
                you MUST contact us prior to the commencement of the applicable cancellation policy to prevent
                cancellation of your reservation and avoid applicable fees from the hotel provider. You agree to pay any
                change or cancellation fees that you incur. You also agree to abide by the terms imposed with respect to
                your prepaid travel reservations. As noted above, Service Fees may be nonrefundable, even if you change or
                cancel a booking.</p>

            <p>Travel Agent is entitled to act on instructions received using your email address and itinerary number or
                credit card. No reservation made by Travel Agent, of any type, may be assigned or transferred to any
                third party except as expressly permitted by Travel Agent in writing. We reserve the right to cancel any
                and all bookings or other transactions you have made using the Site after you have been prohibited from
                using the Services. Travel Agent may also interrupt your access to the Site, without liability to you or
                any other user, for the performance of maintenance on the Site, or to correct issues on the Site.</p>

            <p>Travel Agent will make no refund in the event of, and has no responsibility for expenses caused by, any
                delay, cancellation, overbooking, strike, force majeure, pandemic, government action, or other causes
                beyond its direct control. In the event that a hotel provider is unable to honor your reservation,
                Travel Agent will not be liable for any cost or loss incurred due to rebooking.</p>

            <h3>International Transactions and Travel</h3>

            <p>Some banks and credit or debit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are
                making a booking from outside of the United States on a United States credit or debit card, your bank
                may convert the payment amount, both for the room and the membership fee charged by Travel Agent, to
                your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means that the amount listed on your credit or
                bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore may be a different figure than the
                figure shown on the billing summary page for the reservation booked through Travel Agent. In addition, a
                foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit or debit card is located
                outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international
                transaction by the bank or card company, since we may pass on your payment to an international travel
                supplier. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking,
                please contact your bank. If there are signs of fraud, abuse, or suspicious activity, Travel Agent may
                cancel any bookings associated with your name and retain any Service Fees.</p>

            <p>Currencies fluctuate in value. All payments and refunds are currently processed in United States dollars
                and will reflect the exchange rate in effect on the date of the payment or refund. All refunds are
                subject to this variation, and Travel Agent is not responsible for any difference in exchange rates
                between time of payment and the time of refund. Currency rates are based on various publicly available
                sources and should be used as guidelines only. Rates are not verified as accurate, and actual rates may
                vary. Currency quotes are not updated in real time. You should check the date on the currency converter
                feature for the day that currency was last updated. The information supplied by this application is
                believed to be accurate, but Travel Agent and the providers do not warrant or guarantee such accuracy.
                When using this information for any financial purpose, we advise you to consult a qualified professional
                to verify the accuracy of the currency rates. We do not authorize the use of this information for any
                purpose other than your personal use, and you are prohibited from the use of this information for
                commercial purposes. Some jurisdictions may have different requirements, so these provisions may not
                apply to you.</p>

            <p>Travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Travel Agent urges passengers to
                review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the United States
                Government prior to booking travel to international destinations. You are responsible for ensuring that
                you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas
                (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and that any other foreign entry requirements
                are met. Information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to
                particular international destinations can be found at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov, www.dot.gov,
                www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov, and www.customs.gov.</p>

            <h3>Limitations on Group Bookings</h3>

            <p>You may not book more than 8 rooms online or similar services for the same hotel/stay dates, and if you
                do, we may at our sole discretion cancel your reservation(s) and charge you any applicable fees. If you
                purchased a nonrefundable rate or rates for special events (i.e., Mardi Gras, Super Bowl, etc.), the
                cost of your entire reservation may be subject to forfeiture. If you wish to book 9 or more
                reservations, you must contact our group travel specialists by phone or by filling out the <a
                        href="../../groups.guestreservations.com/Group-Rate/index.html" title="Group Rates">group travel form
                    online</a>. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay a nonrefundable deposit,
                depending upon the nature of your request.</p>

            <p>You may not hold duplicate reservations for the same hotel for overlapping dates under the same name. If
                booking more than one room, each reservation must have a unique customer assigned to each room. Travel
                Agent reserves the right to cancel any reservation that is considered a duplicate booking. Travel Agent
                is not responsible for any cancellation or no-show fees as a result of a duplicate cancellation. You are
                responsible for any additional expenses, fees, and rate increases incurred as a result of a duplicate
                reservation.</p>

            <h3>Impermissible Activities</h3>

            <p>You agree not to violate this Contract or any applicable laws or regulations. In particular, you agree
                not to: make any speculative, false, or fraudulent reservations; violate the restrictions in any robot
                exclusion headers on the Site; use Travel Agent, the Site, or the Services for any commercial purpose
                without the prior written consent of Travel Agent; use the Site to violate any rights of Travel Agent or
                any third parties; take any action that imposes, or may impose, an unreasonable or disproportionately
                large load on our Site, Services, or infrastructure; deep link to any portion of Site; or “frame,”
                “mirror,” or otherwise incorporate any part of Site and/or Services into any other product or service
                without the prior written consent of Travel Agent.</p>

            <h3>Consent to Email and Phone Communications</h3>

            <p>By signing up to receive newsletters, booking reservations, providing your email address,
                and/or providing your phone number, you expressly agree to receive electronic communications from Travel Agent.
                Travel Agent may also obtain your separate express consent to receive communications from Travel Agent,
                including marketing, by text message to the mobile number you provide to Travel Agent, where messaging and data rates may apply.
                These communications will be account, booking, transactional, membership, promotional, or travel-related.

                You can opt-out of receiving electronic communications at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions
                contained in each communication, including to text “STOP” to stop receiving marketing text messages, or

                not apply to non-promotional emails or communications.</p>

            <h3>Site Content Ownership</h3>

            <p>The content and information pertaining to the Services (including, but not limited to, price,
                descriptions and availability), as well as the infrastructure used to provide such content and
                information, is proprietary to Travel Agent or its licensors. While you may make limited copies of your
                travel itinerary (and related documents) for your bookings made through Travel Agent for your personal
                use, you agree not to otherwise modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce,
                publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, sell or re-sell any information, software,
                products, or services obtained from or through the Services or the Site.</p>

            <h3>Defense and Indemnification by You</h3>

            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Travel Agent and its representatives, agents, suppliers,
                vendors, providers, employees, owners, directors, officers, successors, and assigns (in each case, a
                “Beneficiary”) harmless from and against any and all damages, liabilities, losses, costs, fines, taxes,
                attorney’s fees, and expenses (“Costs”), arising out of or related to your acts, errors, omissions,
                representations, warranties, breaches, or violations, regardless of legal theory. Further, if you use
                the Site on behalf of a third party, such as a family member or a traveling companion, you are
                responsible for any error in the accuracy of information provided in connection with such use and must
                inform the party of this Contract, including all rules and restrictions; and each user using the Site on
                behalf of a third party agrees to indemnify and hold Travel Agent and any Beneficiary harmless from and
                against any and all Costs relating to the third party’s or the user’s failure to fulfill any of its
                obligations as described above. Each Beneficiary shall provide prompt written notice of and cooperate in
                the defense of any claim.</p>

            <p>Allianz Global Assistance offers and sells trip insurance on our Site. If you purchase this trip insurance, 
                you are subject to <a target="_blank" title="Allianz Global Assistance" href="https://www.allianztravelinsurance.com/about/terms-of-use.htm">Allianz Global Assistance’s separate Terms, conditions, and exclusions</a>. 
                We are not a party to your separate contract with Allianz Global Assistance, and any questions or concerns

            </p>
            <h3>DMCA Policy</h3>

            <p>Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), if you believe content on the Site violates
                your copyright(s), you may submit an "Infringement Notice” to our DMCA Department,
                <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d3b7beb0b293b4a6b6a0a7a1b6a0b6a1a5b2a7babcbda0fdb0bcbe">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Your Infringement Notice must contain: (a) a signature, electronic or
                physical, of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf, (b) an identification of
                the copyright claimed to have been infringed, (c) a description of the nature and location of the
                material that you claim infringes on your copyright, in sufficient detail to permit us to find and
                identify that material, (d) your name, address, telephone number, and email address, and (e) a statement
                by you: (i) that you believe in good faith that the use of the material that you claim to infringe your
                copyright is not authorized by law, or by the copyright owner or such owner's agent, and (ii) under
                penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in your Infringement Notice is accurate, and
                that you are either the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf. We will respond
                to compliant Infringement Notices, including as appropriate, by removing or disabling links to the
                offending material. If we take action, we will make a good faith attempt to contact the party who made
                the content available at the party’s most recent email address. Under the DMCA, you may be liable for
                damages based on material misrepresentations in your Infringement Notice. You should also make a
                good-faith evaluation regarding fair use. If you are unsure about an Infringement Notice, you should
                first contact an attorney.</p>

            <p>If you have a good faith belief that we removed your content in error, you may submit a “Counter Notice”
                to <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b7d3dad4d6f7d0c2d2c4c3c5d2c4d2c5c1d6c3ded8d9c499d4d8da">[email&#160;protected]</a> with the following information: (a) your name, address, and phone number,
                (b) any ID found at the bottom of any notification, (c) the location of the content we removed, (d) a
                statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed in
                error, (e) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of federal district court for the judicial
                district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any
                judicial district in which the applicable parties may be found, and that you will accept service of
                process from the person who provided the original complaint, and (f) a physical or electronic signature.
                If we receive notice that a user has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we may suspend and/or terminate
                the user’s account or take any other action in our discretion under our repeat infringer policy.</p>

            <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

            <p>Travel Agent may modify the terms of this Contract at any time by posting a new version on the Site, and
                you should review the Contract each time you use the Site or Services. If you do not agree to the
                modified terms, you will not be bound by the modified terms if you email <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5d31383a3c311d3a28382e292f382e382f2b3c293432332e733e3230">[email&#160;protected]</a>
                within 30 days of the date of the modified terms, outlining your disagreement, and thereafter
                discontinuing your use of the Site and the Services; if you do so, you will still be bound by any prior
                version of the terms. This Contract may not otherwise be amended except in writing, signed by you and
                Travel Agent. This Contract constitutes the entire contract between you and Travel Agent with respect to
                the subject matters hereof. This Contract is severable. If any provision of this Contract is held to be
                invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible, or if not
                enforceable, then struck, and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent. You
                agree that Travel Agent may assign this Contract and any incorporated contracts in its sole discretion.
                Headings are for reference purposes only. Except as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this Contract
                shall be construed as creating or constituting a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship
                between you and Travel Agent (or any Beneficiary). Travel Agent’s failure to insist on strict
                performance of this Contract or to act with respect to a breach does not waive any of its rights.</p>
